                                             <h3>Transfer of Personal Data </h3>
                                                <p>We will share your Personal Data within Ahlan and any such group companies of Ahlan. We ensure your Personal Data is protected by requiring all group companies to follow the same rules when Processing your Personal Data. </p>

                                                 <p>Some third parties may be based outside of the Kingdom of Bahrain and so the Processing of your Personal Data may require a transfer of Personal Data outside of the Kingdom of Bahrain. </p>
                                                
                                                 <p>Whenever we transfer your Personal Data to third parties which are based outside the Kingdom of Bahrain we ensure that a similar degree of protection is afforded to your Personal Data.    </p>
          
                                                 <p>There are limited occurrences where we are able to transfer your Personal Data outside of the Kingdom of Bahrain. For all other occurrences, your consent will be obtained prior to such transfer.  </p>

                                         <h3>Data security </h3>

                                        <p>All Personal Data you provide to us is stored on our secure servers. Any payment transactions (carried out by us or our chosen third-party provider of payment processing services) will be encrypted using encryption technology. Where we have given you (or where you have chosen) a password that enables you to access certain parts of the Site or the Application, you are responsible for keeping this password confidential. We ask you not to share a password with anyone.  </p>
                                         <p>Once we have received your Personal Data, we will use strict procedures and security features to try to prevent your Personal Data from being accidentally lost, used or accessed in an unauthorized way.  </p>
                                          <p>We will collect and store Personal Data on your device using data caches and browser web storage (including HTML5) and other technology.  </p>
                                        <p>The Services or the Application may include social networking, chat room or forum features. Ensure when using these features that you do not submit any Personal Data that you do not want to be seen, collected or used by other users.  </p>

                                        <p>We have put in place procedures to deal with any suspected Personal Data breach and will notify you and any applicable regulator when we are legally required to do so.  </p>


                                           <h3>Data retention  </h3>

                                             <p>We will only retain your Personal Data for as long as necessary to fulfil the purposes for which we collected it, including for the purposes of satisfying any legal, accounting or reporting requirements.  </p>
                                           <p>In some circumstances we will anonymize your Personal Data (so that it can no longer be associated with you) for research or statistical purposes, in which case we may use this information indefinitely without further notice to you.  </p>

                                             <p>In the event you do not use the Application for a period of one (1) year then we will treat the account as expired and your Personal Data may be deleted. </p>

You also have the right to ask us to delete or remove your Personal Data where you have successfully exercised your right to object to Processing (see below), where we may have Processed your Personal Data unlawfully or where we are required to erase your Personal Data to comply with applicable law. Note, however, that we may not always be able to comply with your request of erasure for specific legal reasons which will be notified to you, if applicable, at the time of your request.

However, this will not affect the lawfulness of any Processing carried out before you withdraw your consent. If you withdraw your consent, we may not be able to provide the Services to you. We will advise you if this is the case at the time you withdraw your consent.

You also have the right to object where we are processing your Personal Data for direct marketing purposes (and you will always be able to opt-out via the “unsubscribe” link on an email from us). In some cases, we may demonstrate that we have compelling legitimate grounds to process your information which override your rights and freedoms.

This is a security measure to ensure that your Personal Data is not disclosed to someone who has no right to receive it.
