                <h3>Your Account </h3>
                <p>Before you can place Online Orders using the Application you need to open an Ahlan Application account ("Account"). When you open an Account you may create a password or other secure login method and may have to provide payment card details. You are responsible for keeping your Account username, password, or other secure login method confidential and not disclosing these to any other person. If another person uses these methods to access your Account, you will be liable to pay for any Online Orders they submit, and we are not responsible for any losses you suffer as a result, unless the person using your password obtained it because we did not keep it secure. </p>
                <p>You may close your Account at any time by requesting to do so in your Account section of the Site and/or Application or by contacting us using the contact details above. We may suspend your access to your Account, or close it permanently, if we believe that your Account has been used by someone else. We may also close your Account if in our opinion you are abusing the service provided by the Site and/or Application (for example, by applying for refunds or credit to which we do not consider you are entitled, making repeated unreasonable complaints, mistreating our staff, or any other good reason).  </p>
                
                <h3>Availability </h3>
                <p>Each Merchant has a prescribed delivery area. This delivery area may change at any time due to factors such as weather, or demand on our service. This is to ensure that Delivery Orders reach you at their best. The Merchants each decide their own operating hours which means that availability of options and the range of Merchants to which you can submit Delivery Orders, depends on the Merchants in your area. If you try to place a Delivery Order for delivery to a location outside the delivery area or operating hours of a Merchant, or the Application is otherwise unavailable for any reason, we will notify that such Delivery Order will not be possible.  </p>
           
                <h3>Online Orders  </h3>
                <p>Once you have selected your Online Order from the menu of your chosen Merchant you will be given the opportunity to submit your Online Order by clicking on the ��Checkout�� button. Please check the information that you enter and correct any errors before clicking on the ��Checkout�� button since once you click on this, errors cannot be corrected. </p>
                <p>Once you submit your Online Order, we will send you an email confirming that your Online Order has been received and accepted by the Merchant (the "Confirmation Email").  </p>
                <p>The contract for the supply of an Online Order using the Application will be between you and the Merchant and will only be formed when you have been sent the Confirmation Email by us.  </p>
                <p>If we are unable to accept an Online Order, we will inform you of this in writing and you will not be charged for the Online Order.  </p>
                <p>All Online Orders are subject to availability.  </p>
                <p>A Merchant may offer an alternative if any part or ingredient required to fulfil an Online Order is not available. Such alternative may be offered after you have received the Confirmation Email. If you do not wish to accept the alternative then you are entitled to cancel the Online Order and you will be refunded the price of the Online Order.  </p>
              
              <h3>Delivery Orders </h3>
              <p>Our aim is to provide the best delivery service possible. We will do our best to ensure that your Delivery Order is delivered by the time specified in the Confirmation Email and Application. Delivery time that is showing in the Merchant��s logo interface means the average time and is not a fixed time for the delivery. For the avoidance of doubt, the expected delivery time is not a fixed time, it is an approximation. We will notify you of any unforeseen delays. </p>
              <p>Delivery will be at the address you provide when you place the Delivery Order. Please ensure that you provide an accurate address and telephone number to ensure that your Delivery Orders arrive to the correct location.  </p>
              <p>If you need to change the delivery location after you have placed the Delivery Order, we may be able to change the delivery address to an alternative one that is registered with your Account if you inform us prior to the delivery driver being dispatched and the replacement address is within the delivery zone for that Merchant. If we cannot change the delivery address, you have the option to cancel the Delivery Order but you will be charged if the Delivery Order is a Started Order.  </p>
              <p>If you do not open the door or respond to telephonic correspondence within 10 minutes of our delivery driver physically reaching your provided address, we reserve the right to leave such address and you will be charged for the Delivery Order. </p>
              <h3>Pick-Up Orders </h3>
              <p>If you submit a Pick-Up Order you will be required to collect your Pick-Up Order from the Merchant. You will have the option to select the collection time of your Pick-Up Order, which must be at least 30 minutes after the time at which you submitted the Pick-Up Order. You must arrive at the Merchant just before the time for collection stated on the Application and/or in the Confirmation Email. The Merchant will hold your Pick-Up Order for up to 30 minutes after the stated collection time, following which the Merchant may dispose of your Pick-Up Order. You will still be charged for a Pick-Up Order that you fail to collect from the Merchant.  </p>
              <h3>Cancellation and Changes </h3>
              <p>Ahlan and/or the Merchant may cancel any Online Order, before or after acceptance and will notify you immediately of such cancellation and refund you for the Online Order using the same method you used to pay for your Online Order. All Online Orders paid for by any means other than cash will be refunded within fourteen business days.  </p>
              <p>A Merchant will classify a ��Started Order�� as any Online Order, in respect of which food preparation has begun. </p>
              <p>You have the right to cancel or change an Online Order at any time before the Online Order becomes a Started Order. Any Online Order cancelled or changed by you after it becomes a Started Order will be charged to you. Ahlan in its absolute and sole discretion will determine whether an Online Order is deemed a Started Order or not. </p>
              <p>You can cancel or change an Online Order by directly contacting the Merchant or by contacting the Application Call Centre on [ <a href="tel:+97317434353">17434353</a> ] or by sending a request through the live chat function on the Application. </p>

              <h3>Price and payment </h3>
              <p>The price of any Online Order will be listed on the Application (such prices shall be inclusive of any applicable tax). Prices will vary between Merchants. Prior to confirming your Online Order the final price will be displayed in the Application, which will include the delivery fee if the Online Order is a Delivery Order.  </p>
              <p>Prices are liable to change at any time, but changes will not affect Online Orders in respect of which you have received the Confirmation Email, save in the case of a pricing mistake, whereby we will notify you as soon as possible. You may be able to cancel your Online Order once we notify you. Despite our best efforts, some of the Products listed on the Application may be incorrectly priced. The relevant Merchant will normally verify prices as part of the Online Order process.  </p>
              <p>Delivery charges are calculated per Delivery Order and calculated by Ahlan. Any delivery charges or any other fees will be displayed clearly in your Delivery Order summary prior to checkout. </p>

Payment is made directly to Ahlan and is subsequently passed on by Ahlan to the Merchants.  </p>
              <p>We are authorized by the Merchants to accept payment on their behalf (both in cash and by electronic payments) and payment of the price of any Online Order by you to us will discharge your obligations to pay such price to the Merchants. </p>
              <p>Loyalty points accumulated through Ahlan Credit can be utilized for the payment of Orders by equating it to the denomination in terms of monetary value as detailed in clause 11 (Ahlan Credit). </p>
              <p>If the Ahlan Member��s bank account currency is different to that in which the prices are listed on the Application, the Ahlan Member��s bank will apply their own applicable exchange rate. Ahlan is not responsible for such exchange rates. </p>
